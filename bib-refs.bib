  abstract = {Image analysis methods must be tested and evaluated within a controlled environment. Simulations can be an extremely helpful tool for validation because ground truth is known. We created the digital brain phantom that is at the heart of our publicly available database of realistic simulated magnetic resonance image (MRI) volumes known as BrainWeb. Even though the digital phantom had l~mm3 isotropic voxel size and a small number of tissue classes, the BrainWeb database has been used in more than one hundred peer-reviewed publications validating different image processing methods. In this paper, we describe the next step in the natural evolution of BrainWeb: the creation of digital brain phantom II that includes three major improvements over the original phantom. First, the realism of the phantom, and the resulting simulations, was improved by modeling more tissue classes to include blood vessels, bone marrow and dura mater classes. In addition. a more realistic skull class was created. The latter is particularly useful for SPECT, PET and CT simulations for which bone attenuation has an important effect. Second, the phantom was improved by an eight-fold reduction in voxel volume to 0.125~mm3. Third, the method used to create the new phantom was modified not only to take into account the segmentation of these new structures, but also to take advantage of many more automated procedures now available. The overall process has reduced subjectivity and manual intervention when compared to the original phantom, and the process may be easily applied to create phantoms from other subjects. MRI simulations are shown to illustrate the difference between the previous and the new improved digital brain phantom II. Example PET and SPECT simulations are also presented. {\copyright} 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {To increase the reliability for the non-invasive determination of the irritative zone in presurgical epilepsy diagnosis, we introduce here a new experimental and methodological source analysis pipeline that combines the complementary information in EEG and MEG, and apply it to data from a patient, suffering from refractory focal epilepsy. Skull conductivity parameters in a six compartment finite element head model with brain anisotropy, constructed from individual MRI data, are estimated in a calibration procedure using somatosensory evoked potential (SEP) and field (SEF) data. These data are measured in a single run before acquisition of further runs of spontaneous epileptic activity. Our results show that even for single interictal spikes, volume conduction effects dominate over noise and need to be taken into account for accurate source analysis. While cerebrospinal fluid and brain anisotropy influence both modalities, only EEG is sensitive to skull conductivity and conductivity calibration significantly reduces the difference in especially depth localization of both modalities, emphasizing its importance for combining EEG and MEG source analysis. On the other hand, localization differences which are due to the distinct sensitivity profiles of EEG and MEG persist. In case of a moderate error in skull conductivity, combined source analysis results can still profit from the different sensitivity profiles of EEG and MEG to accurately determine location, orientation and strength of the underlying sources. On the other side, significant errors in skull modeling are reflected in EEG reconstruction errors and could reduce the goodness of fit to combined datasets. For combined EEG and MEG source analysis, we therefore recommend calibrating skull conductivity using additionally acquired SEP/SEF data. {\copyright} 2014 Aydin et al.},

In comparing a Boundary Element (BEM) and a Finite Element Method (FEM) for forward electroencephalography, in our early numerical experiments, we found the FEM to have a better accuracy than the BEM. This triggered a quest to improve the accuracy of Boundary Element Methods and led us to study the extended Green representation theorem. A fundamental result in potential theory shows that, up to an additive constant, a harmonic function is determined within a domain from its value on the boundary (Dirichlet condition), or the value of its normal derivative (Neumann condition). The Green Representation Theorem has been used in forward EEG and MEG modeling, in deriving the Geselowitz BEM formulation, and the Isolated Problem Approach. The extended Green Representation Theorem provides a representation for the directional derivatives of a piecewise-harmonic function. By introducing the normal current as an additional variable in the forward problem, we derive a new Boundary Element Method, which leads to a symmetric matrix structure: we hence call it the Symmetric BEM. Accuracy comparisons demonstrate the superiority of the Symmetric BEM to the FEM and to the classical BEM. {\copyright} Springer-Verlag 2010.},

  abstract = {For a dipole source, theory predicts 3 useful differences between the MEG and EEG spatial patterns over the head. These are seen when a comparison is made between theoretical MEG and EEG maps, due to the dipole in a spherical model of the head. If true, these differences would allow the MEG to better localize or differentiate neural sources in some ways than does the EEG. A first experimental test of the differences is made here. A comparison is made between MEG and EEG maps due to a neural source which appears to behave as a dipole (N20 of the somatic evoked response). The same 3 differences are seen, therefore the predicted differences are confirmed experimentally. The first 2 differences, due only to the tangential component of the dipole, are that the MEG pattern is rotated by 90{$^\circ$} from the EEG pattern and is one-third tighter. The first allows the MEG to localize a tangential dipole better in a preferred direction, across the dipole (while the EEG does so along the dipole); the second allows the MEG to localize somewhat better in its preferred direction than the EEG does in its preferred direction. The third difference is due only to the radial component of the dipole; while the MEG receives no contribution from this component, the EEG pattern is asymmetrical and is heavily weighted by it. This allows the MEG to reveal tangential sources which are obscured by the radial sources in the EEG. For sources which cannot be approximated by a dipole, the MEG-EEG differences will depend on the particular case; however, the spherical model can now be used with more confidence to predict differences in these cases. {\copyright} 1983.},

  abstract = {After conception and implementation of any new medical image processing algorithm, validation is an important step to ensure that the procedure fulfills all requirements set forth at the initial design stage. Although the algorithm must be evaluated on real data, a comprehensive validation requires the additional use of simulated data since it is impossible to establish ground truth with in vivo data. Experiments with simulated data permit controlled evaluation over a wide range of conditions (e.g., different levels of noise, contrast, intensity artefacts, or geometric distortion). Such considerations have become increasingly important with the rapid growth of neuroimaging, i.e., computational analysis of brain structure and function using brain scanning methods such as positron emission tomography and magnetic resonance imaging. Since simple objects such as ellipsoids or parall{\'e}l{\'e}pip{\`e}des do not reflect the complexity of natural brain anatomy, we present the design and creation of a realistic, high-resolution, digital, volumetric phantom of the human brain. This three-dimensional digital brain phantom is made up of ten volumetric data sets that define the spatial distribution for different tissues (e.g., grey matter, white matter, muscle, skin, etc.), where voxel intensity is proportional to the fraction of tissue within the voxel. The digital brain phantom can be used to simulate tomographic images of the head. Since the contribution of each tissue type to each voxel in the brain phantom is known, it can be used as the gold standard to test analysis algorithms such as classification procedures which seek to identify the tissue "type" of each image voxel. Furthermore, since the same anatomical phantom may be used to drive simulators for different modalities, it is the ideal tool to test intermodality registration algorithms. The brain phantom and simulated MR images have been made publicly available on the Internet (http://www.bic.mni.mcgill.ca/brainweb). {\copyright} 1998 IEEE.},

Local models, where each skull location was modeled differently, and global models, where the skull was assumed to be homogeneous, were compared to a reference model, in which spongy and compact bone were explicitly accounted for. In both cases, isotropic and anisotropic conductivity assumptions were taken into account. We considered sources in the entire brain and determined errors both in the forward calculation and the reconstructed dipole position. Our results show that accounting for the local variations over the skull surface is important, whereas assuming isotropic or anisotropic skull conductivity has little influence. Moreover, we showed that, if using an isotropic and homogeneous skull model, the ratio between skin/brain and skull conductivities should be considerably lower than the commonly used 80:1. For skull modeling, we recommend (1) Local models: if compact and spongy bone can be identified with sufficient accuracy (e.g., from MRI) and their conductivities can be assumed to be known (e.g., from measurements), one should model these explicitly by assigning each voxel to one of the two conductivities, (2) Global models: if the conditions of (1) are not met, one should model the skull as either homogeneous and isotropic, but with considerably higher skull conductivity than the usual 0.0042 S/m, or as homogeneous and anisotropic, but with higher radial skull conductivity than the usual 0.0042 S/m and a considerably lower radial:tangential conductivity anisotropy than the usual 1:10. {\copyright} 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

  abstract = {With the increasing availability of surface extraction techniques for magnetic resonance and x-ray computed tomography images, realistic head models can be readily generated as forward models in the analysis of electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) data. Inverse analysis of this data, however, requires that the forward model be computationally efficient. We propose two methods for approximating the EEG forward model using realistic head shapes. The 'sensor-fitted sphere' approach fits a multilayer sphere individually to each sensor, and the 'three-dimensional interpolation' scheme interpolates using a grid on which a numerical boundary element method (BEM) solution has been precomputed. We have characterized the performance of each method in terms of magnitude and subspace error metrics, as well as computational and memory requirements. We have also made direct performance comparisons with traditional spherical models. The approximation provided by the interpolative scheme had an accuracy nearly identical to full BEM, even within 3 mm of the inner skull surface. Forward model computation during inverse procedures was approximately 30 times faster than for a traditional three-shell spherical model. Cast in this framework, high-fidelity numerical solutions currently viewed as computationally prohibitive for solving the inverse problem (e.g. linear Galerkin BEM) can be rapidly recomputed in a highly efficient manner. The sensor-fitting method has a similar one-time cost to the BEM method, and while it produces some improvement over a standard three-shell sphere, its performance does not approach that of the interpolation method. In both methods, there is a one-time cost associated with precomputing the forward solution over a set of grid points.},

In this paper, we evaluate the performance in localizing EEG dipole sources using simulated annealing (SA), genetic algorithm (GA), particle swarm optimization (PSO), and differential evolution (DE). The evaluation is performed in terms of the metaheuristics' operational parameters and the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Here, the objective function in the optimization problem is the concentrated likelihood function (CLF), while the Cram{\'e}r-Rao bound is proposed as benchmark. Under these conditions, the metaheuristics' best performances are achieved when the variance of their corresponding dipole source estimates is close to the CRB. Therefore, we exhaustively evaluate the variances of the source estimates obtained through each metaheuristic for the case of realistically simulated EEG data. Our results showed that no significant variations on the performance were introduced by changes in the metaheuristics' operational parameters, specially in one-dipole estimation. For two-dipole estimation, the performance of GA and DE was better than in other metaheuristics, but DE required a fine adjustment of its parameters in order to work. In all cases, the performance decayed as the SNR decreased, while SA and PSO seemed to be very sensitive to the correlation between the sources. Overall, GA was the most attractive technique in terms of performance and computational cost. {\copyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

In this paper, we apply the maximum-likelihood and maximum a posteriori (MAP) techniques to simultaneously estimate the layer conductivity ratios and source signal using EEG data. We use the classical 4-sphere model to approximate the head geometry, and assume a known dipole source position. The accuracy of our estimates is evaluated by comparing their standard deviations with the Cram{\'e}r-Rao bound (CRB). The applicability of these techniques is illustrated with numerical examples on simulated EEG data.

The use of an ellipsoidal geometry is useful in cases for which incorporating the anisotropy of the head is important but a better model cannot be defined. The structure of our forward solutions facilitates the analysis of the inverse problem by factoring the lead field into a product of the current dipole source and a kernel containing the information corresponding to the head geometry and location of the source and sensors. This factorization allows the inverse problem to be approached as an explicit function of just the location parameters, which reduces the complexity of the estimation solution search. Our forward solutions have the potential of facilitating the solution of the inverse problem, as they provide algebraic representations suitable for numerical implementation. The applicability of our models is illustrated with numerical examples on real EEG/MEG data of N20 responses. Our results show that the residual data after modeling the N20 response using a dipole for the source and an ellipsoidal geometry for the head is in average lower than the residual remaining when a spherical geometry is used for the same estimated dipole. {\copyright} 2006 IEEE.},

  abstract = {Background. The aim of electroencephalogram (EEG) source localization is to find the brain areas responsible for EEG waves of interest. It consists of solving forward and inverse problems. The forward problem is solved by starting from a given electrical source and calculating the potentials at the electrodes. These evaluations are necessary to solve the inverse problem which is defined as finding brain sources which are responsible for the measured potentials at the EEG electrodes. Methods. While other reviews give an extensive summary of the both forward and inverse problem, this review article focuses on different aspects of solving the forward problem and it is intended for newcomers in this research field. Results. It starts with focusing on the generators of the EEG: the post-synaptic potentials in the apical dendrites of pyramidal neurons. These cells generate an extracellular current which can be modeled by Poisson's differential equation, and Neumann and Dirichlet boundary conditions. The compartments in which these currents flow can be anisotropic (e.g. skull and white matter). In a three-shell spherical head model an analytical expression exists to solve the forward problem. During the last two decades researchers have tried to solve Poisson's equation in a realistically shaped head model obtained from 3D medical images, which requires numerical methods. The following methods are compared with each other: the boundary element method (BEM), the finite element method (FEM) and the finite difference method (FDM). In the last two methods anisotropic conducting compartments can conveniently be introduced. Then the focus will be set on the use of reciprocity in EEG source localization. It is introduced to speed up the forward calculations which are here performed for each electrode position rather than for each dipole position. Solving Poisson's equation utilizing FEM and FDM corresponds to solving a large sparse linear system. Iterative methods are required to solve these sparse linear systems. The following iterative methods are discussed: successive over-relaxation, conjugate gradients method and algebraic multigrid method. Conclusion. Solving the forward problem has been well documented in the past decades. In the past simplified spherical head models are used, whereas nowadays a combination of imaging modalities are used to accurately describe the geometry of the head model. Efforts have been done on realistically describing the shape of the head model, as well as the heterogenity of the tissue types and realistically determining the conductivity. However, the determination and validation of the in vivo conductivity values is still an important topic in this field. In addition, more studies have to be done on the influence of all the parameters of the head model and of the numerical techniques on the solution of the forward problem. {\copyright} 2007 Hallez et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

  abstract = {Magnetoencephalography (MEG) is a noninvasive technique for investigating neuronal activity in the living human brain. The time resolution of the method is better than 1 ms and the spatial discrimination is, under favorable circumstances, 2-3 mm for sources in the cerebral cortex. In MEG studies, the weak 10 fT-1 pT magnetic fields produced by electric currents flowing in neurons are measured with multichannel SQUID (superconducting quantum interference device) gradiometers. The sites in the cerebral cortex that are activated by a stimulus can be found from the detected magnetic-field distribution, provided that appropriate assumptions about the source render the solution of the inverse problem unique. Many interesting properties of the working human brain can be studied, including spontaneous activity and signal processing following external stimuli. For clinical purposes, determination of the locations of epileptic foci is of interest. The authors begin with a general introduction and a short discussion of the neural basis of MEG. The mathematical theory of the method is then explained in detail, followed by a thorough description of MEG instrumentation, data analysis, and practical construction of multi-SQUID devices. Finally, several MEG experiments performed in the authors' laboratory are described, covering studies of evoked responses and of spontaneous activity in both healthy and diseased brains. Many MEG studies by other groups are discussed briefly as well. {\copyright} 1993 The American Physical Society.},

The value usually taken for the conductivity of skull is questionable. In a carefully chosen procedure, in which sterility, a stable temperature, and relative humidity were guaranteed, we measured the (lumped, homogeneous) conductivity of the skull in five patients undergoing epilepsy surgery, using an extended four-point method. Twenty-eight current configurations were used, in each of which the potential due to an applied current was measured. A finite difference model, incorporating the geometry of the skull and the electrode locations, derived from CT data, was used to mimic the measurements. The conductivity values found were ranging from 32 mS/m to 80 mS/m, which is much higher than the values reported in other studies. Causes for these higher conductivity values are discussed.},

Several MEG analysis toolboxes include an implementation of a linearly constrained minimum-variance (LCMV) beamformer. However, differences in implementations and in their results complicate the selection and application of beamformers and may hinder their wider adoption in research and clinical use. Additionally, combinations of different MEG sensor types (such as magnetometers and planar gradiometers) and application of preprocessing methods for interference suppression, such as signal space separation (SSS), can affect the results in different ways for different implementations. So far, a systematic evaluation of the different implementations has not been performed. Here, we compared the localization performance of the LCMV beamformer pipelines in four widely used open-source toolboxes (MNE-Python, FieldTrip, DAiSS (SPM12), and Brainstorm) using datasets both with and without SSS interference suppression. We analyzed MEG data that were i) simulated, ii) recorded from a static and moving phantom, and iii) recorded from a healthy volunteer receiving auditory, visual, and somatosensory stimulation. We also investigated the effects of SSS and the combination of the magnetometer and gradiometer signals. We quantified how localization error and point-spread volume vary with the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in all four toolboxes. When applied carefully to MEG data with a typical SNR (3--15 \hspace{0pt}dB), all four toolboxes localized the sources reliably; however, they differed in their sensitivity to preprocessing parameters. As expected, localizations were highly unreliable at very low SNR, but we found high localization error also at very high SNRs for the first three toolboxes while Brainstorm showed greater robustness but with lower spatial resolution. We also found that the SNR improvement offered by SSS led to more accurate localization.},

Such indices are based on reduced-rank beamformers, specifically the generalized sidelobe canceler (GSC), and with the purpose of suppressing the contribution of interfering sources and noise. Here, the GSC is modified with an adaptive blocking matrix (ABM) to optimally estimate and later suppress unwanted brain sources. With respect to the rank-reduction, this is achieved through the cross-spectral metrics (CSM) as they give a sense of the affinity of the beamformers' eigenstructure to the orthogonal subspace of noise an interference. Based on that, two different neural indices are proposed for the assessment of brain activation. Our realistic simulations show that a more consistent source localization is achieved through the proposed indices in comparison to the use of the traditional full-rank approach, specifically for brain sources embedded in high background activity that originates at the brain cortex and thalamus. We also prove the applicability of our methods on the localization of sources on the visual cortex produced by steady-state visual-evoked potentials.},

Head tissue conductivity is often assumed from previous literature, however, despite extensive research, measurements are inconsistent. A meta-analysis of reported human head electrical conductivity values was therefore conducted to determine significant variation and subsequent influential factors. Of 3121 identified publications spanning three databases, 56 papers were included in data extraction. Conductivity values were categorised according to tissue type, and recorded alongside methodology, measurement condition, current frequency, tissue temperature, participant pathology and age. We found variation in electrical conductivity of the whole-skull, the spongiform layer of the skull, isotropic, perpendicularly- and parallelly-oriented white matter (WM) and the brain-to-skull-conductivity ratio (BSCR) could be significantly attributed to a combination of differences in methodology and demographics. This large variation should be acknowledged, and care should be taken when creating volume conductor models, ideally constructing them on an individual basis, rather than assuming them from the literature. When personalised models are unavailable, it is suggested weighted average means from the current meta-analysis are used. Assigning conductivity as: 0.41~S/m for the scalp, 0.02~S/m for the whole skull, or when better modelled as a three-layer skull 0.048~S/m for the spongiform layer, 0.007~S/m for the inner compact and 0.005~S/m for the outer compact, as well as 1.71~S/m for the CSF, 0.47~S/m for the grey matter, 0.22~S/m for WM and 50.4 for the BSCR.},

The forward problem involves computing the scalp potentials or external magnetic field at a finite set of sensor locations for a putative source configuration. We present a unified treatment of analytical and numerical solutions of the forward problem in a form suitable for use in inverse methods. This formulation is achieved through factorization of the lead field into the product of the moment of the elemental current dipole source with a "kernel matrix" that depends on the head geometry and source and sensor locations, and a "sensor matrix" that models sensor orientation and gradiometer effects in MEG and differential measurements in EEG. Using this formulation and a recently developed approximation formula for EEG, based on the "Berg parameters," we present novel reformulations of the basic EEG and MEG kernels that dispel the myth that EEG is inherently more complicated to calculate than MEG. We also present novel investigations of different boundary element methods (BEM's) and present evidence that improvements over currently published BEM methods can be realized using alternative error-weighting methods.

  abstract = {Background: Interpreting and controlling bioelectromagnetic phenomena require realistic physiological models and accurate numerical solvers. A semi-realistic model often used in practise is the piecewise constant conductivity model, for which only the interfaces have to be meshed. This simplified model makes it possible to use Boundary Element Methods. Unfortunately, most Boundary Element solutions are confronted with accuracy issues when the conductivity ratio between neighboring tissues is high, as for instance the scalp/skull conductivity ratio in electro-encephalography. To overcome this difficulty, we proposed a new method called the symmetric BEM, which is implemented in the OpenMEEG software. The aim of this paper is to present OpenMEEG, both from the theoretical and the practical point of view, and to compare its performances with other competing software packages.Methods: We have run a benchmark study in the field of electro- and magneto-encephalography, in order to compare the accuracy of OpenMEEG with other freely distributed forward solvers. We considered spherical models, for which analytical solutions exist, and we designed randomized meshes to assess the variability of the accuracy. Two measures were used to characterize the accuracy. the Relative Difference Measure and the Magnitude ratio. The comparisons were run, either with a constant number of mesh nodes, or a constant number of unknowns across methods. Computing times were also compared.Results: We observed more pronounced differences in accuracy in electroencephalography than in magnetoencephalography. The methods could be classified in three categories: the linear collocation methods, that run very fast but with low accuracy, the linear collocation methods with isolated skull approach for which the accuracy is improved, and OpenMEEG that clearly outperforms the others. As far as speed is concerned, OpenMEEG is on par with the other methods for a constant number of unknowns, and is hence faster for a prescribed accuracy level.Conclusions: This study clearly shows that OpenMEEG represents the state of the art for forward computations. Moreover, our software development strategies have made it handy to use and to integrate with other packages. The bioelectromagnetic research community should therefore be able to benefit from OpenMEEG with a limited development effort. {\copyright} 2010 Gramfort et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

In the piecewise constant conductivity head model, this can be accomplished by the boundary element method (BEM) using a suitable integral formulation. Most previous work uses the same integral formulation, corresponding to a double-layer potential. In this paper we present a conceptual framework based on a well-known theorem (Theorem 1) that characterizes harmonic functions defined on the complement of a bounded smooth surface. This theorem says that such harmonic functions are completely defined by their values and those of their normal derivatives on this surface. It allows us to cast the previous BEM approaches in a unified setting and to develop two new approaches corresponding to different ways of exploiting the same theorem. Specifically, we first present a dual approach which involves a single-layer potential. Then, we propose a symmetric formulation, which combines single- and double-layer potentials, and which is new to the field of EEG, although it has been applied to other problems in electromagnetism. The three methods have been evaluated numerically using a spherical geometry with known analytical solution, and the symmetric formulation achieves a significantly higher accuracy than the alternative methods. Additionally, we present results with realistically shaped meshes. Beside providing a better understanding of the foundations of BEM methods, our approach appears to lead also to more efficient algorithms.},

Effective com-munication between patient and therapist is central to achieving these aims. The biopsychosocial model and patient-centred care are two established approaches to health communication and are promoted as frameworks to inform physiotherapy practice. In this chapter, we use empirically derived examples of communication in practice to explore whether and how these approaches are related to communication in physiotherapy. We draw data from two sepa-rate qualitative studies of communicative interactions in primary practice physiotherapy settings. Findings from these two studies demonstrated that physiotherapy clinical communication is struc-tured and physiotherapist-directed, and is adaptive and responsive},

Dipolar and distributed sources at other than the desired location are canceled or attenuated with an adaptive linearly constrained minimum variance (LCMV) beamformer. Actual EEG data acquired from a human subject serves as the interference in a case where the desired source is simulated and superimposed on the actual data. It is shown that the LCMV beamformer extracts the desired dipole time series while effectively canceling the subjects interference.},

A beamformer performs spatial filtering to separate signals that have overlapping frequency content but originate from different spatial locations.

  abstract = {A spatial filtering method for localizing sources of brain electrical activity from surface recordings is described and analyzed. The spatial filters are implemented as a weighted sum of the data recorded at different sites. The weights are chosen to minimize the filter output power subject to a linear constraint. The linear constraint forces the filter to pass brain electrical activity from a specified location, while the power minimization attenuates activity originating at other locations. The estimated output power as a function of location is normalized by the estimated noise power as a function of location to obtain a neural activity index map. Locations of source activity correspond to maxima in the neural activity index map. The method does not require any prior assumptions about the number of active sources of their geometry because it exploits the spatial covariance of the source electrical activity. This paper presents a development and analysis of the method and explores its sensitivity to deviations between actual and assumed data models. The effect on the algorithm of covariance matrix estimation, correlation between sources, and choice of reference is discussed. Simulated and measured data is used to illustrate the efficacy of the approach.},

Beamformers, which were first proposed for MEG more than two decades ago, have since been applied in hundreds of studies, demonstrating that they are a versatile and robust tool for neuroscience. However, certain characteristics of beamformers remain somewhat elusive and there currently does not exist a unified documentation of the mathematical underpinnings and computational subtleties of beamformers as implemented in the most widely used academic open source software packages for MEG analysis (Brainstorm, FieldTrip, MNE, and SPM). Here, we provide such documentation that aims at providing the mathematical background of beamforming and unifying the terminology. Beamformer implementations are compared across toolboxes and pitfalls of beamforming analyses are discussed. Specifically, we provide details on handling rank deficient covariance matrices, prewhitening, the rank reduction of forward fields, and on the combination of heterogeneous sensor types, such as magnetometers and gradiometers. The overall aim of this paper is to contribute to contemporary efforts towards higher levels of computational transparency in functional neuroimaging.},
